Task 1:

This application is supposed to keep track of persons and their relationships
(in memory).

The relationships it needs to keep track of are: marriage and parenthood.
It starts out empty. Persons are added to memory using the method addPerson in
HeritageService. To add a set of persons, you need to call addPerson once per
person. You also need to be able to register relationships between people.
You can choose how to do that.

implement HeritageService so that you can run the following:

HeritageService service = new HeritageService;
service.addPerson(Person person)
service.addPerson(Person person)
....

and then you should be able to do

service.areRelated(person1,person2) and get true if they are, false if not.

Your task is to:

- Fully implement the Person class

- implement HeritageService so that the above code works. Note that it doesn't need to work exactly like that,
  but at least close

- implement a unit test that runs the above code

(more tasks will follow later)
